# StellarStream

StellarStream is a basic payment-streaming MVP for the Stellar ecosystem.

It includes:

- A React dashboard to create and monitor streams
- A Node.js/Express API for stream lifecycle operations
- A Soroban smart contract scaffold for on-chain stream logic
- A backlog folder with implementation task drafts

This repository is intentionally lightweight and easy to extend.

## 1) What The Project Does

StellarStream models a payment stream where a sender allocates a total amount over a fixed duration.  
As time passes, the recipient "vests" value continuously.

Current MVP behavior:

- Create stream
- List streams with live progress
- Cancel stream
- Show computed metrics (active/completed/vested)
- Track and display event history for stream lifecycle actions

## 2) Current Architecture

Frontend (`frontend`, port `3000`)

- React + Vite app
- Uses `/api` proxy to call backend
- Polls stream list every 5 seconds

Backend (`backend`, port `3001`)

- Express REST API
- SQLite database for persistent storage
- Event indexer worker for tracking stream lifecycle
- Computes progress in real time from timestamps

Contract (`contracts`)

- Soroban contract scaffold in Rust
- Supports `create_stream`, `claimable`, `claim`, and `cancel`
- Not yet integrated with backend runtime in this MVP

See also: [Event Flow](#event-flow) for detailed sequence diagrams of the contract-to-frontend pipeline and webhook delivery system.

## Event Flow

### On-Chain Event Pipeline

The following sequence diagram shows how events flow from the Soroban contract through the indexing pipeline to the frontend:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Contract as Soroban Contract
    participant Indexer as Indexer Worker
    participant SQLite as SQLite Database
    participant API as Backend API
    participant Frontend as React Frontend

    User->>Contract: create_stream()
    Contract->>Contract: Transfer tokens (escrow)
    Contract->>Contract: Store stream state
    Contract-->>Stellar: Publish StreamCreated/Claimed/Canceled events
    loop Poll every 10s
        Indexer->>Stellar RPC: Fetch new events
        Stellar RPC-->>Indexer: Stream events (Created, Claimed, Canceled)
        Indexer->>SQLite: Write stream + event(s)
    end
    Frontend->>API: GET /api/streams
    API->>SQLite: Query streams
    SQLite-->>API: Return stream data
    API-->>Frontend: JSON response
    Frontend->>Frontend: Render timeline
    Frontend->>API: GET /api/streams/:id/history
    API->>SQLite: Query stream_events
    SQLite-->>API: Event history
    API-->>Frontend: Event timeline JSON
```

### Webhook Delivery Pipeline

Events from the stream lifecycle are also delivered via HTTP webhooks with retry and dead-letter handling:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Stream as Stream Event
    participant Worker as Webhook Worker
    participant HTTP as HTTP Delivery
    participant Target as Webhook Target
    participant DLQ as Dead Letter Queue (webhook_dead_letters)

    Stream->>Worker: Event detected (created/claimed/canceled)
    Worker->>SQLite: Queue webhook delivery (status='pending')
    loop Retry with fixed delays [5s, 15s, 60s, 300s, 900s]
        Worker->>HTTP: POST payload (application/json)
        HTTP->>Target: Deliver webhook
        Note right of HTTP: Header: X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hmac>
        Target-->>HTTP: 200 OK (success)
        HTTP-->>Worker: Success
        Worker->>SQLite: Update status='success'
        alt Failure (timeout/error/5xx)
            Target-->>HTTP: Error
            HTTP-->>Worker: Failure
            Worker->>SQLite: Schedule retry (next_retry_at)
        end
        SQLite->>Worker: next_retry_at
    end
    alt Max retries exceeded
        Worker->>DLQ: INSERT into webhook_dead_letters
        Worker->>SQLite: DELETE from webhook_deliveries
        Worker->>Logs: Error logged
    end
```

### Claim Flow Pipeline

The following diagram details the full claim lifecycle, from UI interaction to on-chain execution and backend reconciliation:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Recipient as Recipient (User)
    participant Frontend as React Frontend
    participant Freighter as Freighter Wallet
    participant Contract as Soroban Contract
    participant Indexer as Indexer Worker
    participant SQLite as SQLite Database
    participant API as Backend API

    Recipient->>Frontend: Click "Claim"
    Frontend->>API: GET /api/streams/:id (query claimable)
    API-->>Frontend: Return claimable amount
    Frontend->>Freighter: Request signature for claim(streamId, amount)
    Freighter->>Recipient: Prompt for approval
    Recipient-->>Freighter: Approve transaction
    Freighter-->>Frontend: Signed Transaction
    Frontend->>Contract: Submit claim() transaction
    Contract->>Contract: Verify recipient & amount
    Contract->>Contract: Transfer tokens from escrow
    Contract-->>Stellar: Publish Claimed event
    loop Poll every 10s
        Indexer->>Stellar RPC: Fetch new events
        Stellar RPC-->>Indexer: Claimed event
        Indexer->>SQLite: Update stream (amount claimed)
        Indexer->>SQLite: Record claim event
    end
    Frontend->>API: GET /api/streams/:id/history (poll)
    API->>SQLite: Query stream_events
    SQLite-->>API: Return updated history
    API-->>Frontend: Return updated history
    Frontend->>Recipient: Show "Claimed ✓"
```

## 3) Stream Math Model

For each stream:

- `totalAmount`
- `startAt`
- `durationSeconds`
- `end = startAt + durationSeconds`

At time `t`:

- `elapsed = clamp(t - startAt, 0, durationSeconds)`
- `ratio = elapsed / durationSeconds`
- `vested = totalAmount * ratio`
- `remaining = totalAmount - vested`

Status rules:

- `scheduled` when `t < startAt`
- `active` when `startAt <= t < end`
- `completed` when `t >= end`
- `canceled` when stream was canceled

## 4) API Reference

Base URL:

- Local: `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend proxy: `/api`

### `GET /api/health`

Purpose:

- Service health check

Response:

- `service`, `status`, `timestamp`

**Docker Compose Health Check Configuration:**

- **Interval:** 30s
- **Timeout:** 10s
- **Retries:** 3
- **Start Period:** 10s

### `GET /api/streams`

Purpose:

- List streams sorted by newest first, with optional filtering and pagination

Query params (optional):

- `status: scheduled | active | completed | canceled`
- `sender: string` (exact sender match)
- `recipient: string` (exact recipient match)
- `asset: string` (exact asset code match)
- `q: string` (general search term - searches stream ID, sender, recipient, and asset code, case-insensitive)
- `page: number` (integer `>= 1`)
- `limit: number` (integer `1..100`)

Search behavior:

- The `q` parameter performs case-insensitive partial matching across stream ID, sender, recipient, and asset code
- Search combines with other filters (all filters are applied together)
- Empty or whitespace-only search terms are ignored

Pagination behavior:

- If both `page` and `limit` are omitted, legacy mode applies and all matching rows are returned.
- If either `page` or `limit` is provided, pagination mode applies with defaults `page=1` and `limit=20`.

Validation:

- Invalid `status`, `page`, or `limit` returns `400`.

Response:

- `data: Stream[]` (includes computed `progress`)
- `total: number` (filtered count before pagination)
- `page: number` (applied page)
- `limit: number` (applied page size)

### `GET /api/streams/:id`

Purpose:

- Fetch single stream by ID

Response:

- `data: Stream`

Error:

- `404` if stream does not exist

### `GET /api/recipients/:accountId/streams`

Purpose:

- Fetch all streams for a specific recipient account

Path parameters:

- `accountId: string` (Stellar account ID starting with G, exactly 56 characters)

Validation:

- Account ID must be a valid Stellar account ID format

Response:

- `data: Stream[]` (includes computed `progress` for each stream)

Error:

- `400` if account ID is invalid

### `GET /api/assets`

Purpose:

- Fetch the current allowed asset allowlist

Response:

- `data: string[]` (normalized asset codes)

### `POST /api/streams`

Purpose:

- Create a new stream

Request JSON:

- `sender: string`
- `recipient: string`
- `assetCode: string`
- `totalAmount: number`
- `durationSeconds: number` (minimum 60)
- `startAt?: number` (unix seconds)

Validation:

- Sender/recipient must be non-trivial strings
- Asset length must be 2..12
- Amount must be positive
- Duration must be at least 60 seconds

Response:

- `201` with `data: Stream`

### `POST /api/streams/:id/cancel`

Purpose:

- Cancel an existing stream

Response:

- `data: Stream` with canceled state

Error:

- `404` if stream does not exist

### `GET /api/open-issues`

Purpose:

- Returns implementation backlog items shown in UI

Response:

- `data: OpenIssue[]`

### `GET /api/streams/:id/history`

Purpose:

- Fetch event history timeline for a specific stream

Response:

- `data: StreamEvent[]` (ordered by timestamp ascending)

Event types:

- `created`: Stream was created
- `claimed`: Tokens were claimed from the stream
- `canceled`: Stream was canceled
- `start_time_updated`: Start time was modified

Each event includes:

- `id`: Event ID
- `streamId`: Associated stream ID
- `eventType`: Type of event
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp when event occurred
- `actor`: Account that triggered the event (optional)
- `amount`: Amount involved (optional, for created/claimed)
- `metadata`: Additional context (optional)

## 5) Smart Contract (Soroban) Behavior

Contract file:

- `contracts/src/lib.rs`

Data:

- `NextStreamId`
- `Stream(stream_id) -> Stream`

Implemented methods:

- `create_stream(...) -> u64`
- `get_stream(stream_id) -> Stream`
- `claimable(stream_id, at_time) -> i128`
- `claim(stream_id, recipient, amount) -> i128`
- `cancel(stream_id, sender)`

Important note:

- `claim` currently updates accounting only.
- Token transfer wiring is planned as next implementation step.

## 6) Run Locally

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Optional for contract work: Rust + Soroban toolchain

### Option A: Direct npm (Recommended for Development)

From repo root:

```bash
npm run install:all
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```

Manual alternative:

```bash
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

### Option B: Docker Compose with Hot-Reload

For local development with Docker, use the `docker-compose.override.yml` file which automatically mounts source directories and enables hot-reload:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The override file:

- Mounts `./backend/src` and `./frontend/src` into containers for live code changes
- Runs `npm run dev` for both services (ts-node-dev for backend, Vite for frontend)
- Exposes Vite HMR port (5173) for frontend hot module replacement
- Sets `NODE_ENV=development` for the backend

**Features:**

- Backend hot-reload: Changes to `backend/src/**` trigger automatic restart via ts-node-dev
- Frontend hot-reload: Changes to `frontend/src/**` trigger Vite HMR
- Database persists across restarts (mounted volume)
- No need to rebuild images when code changes

**Ports:**

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Vite HMR: `localhost:5173` (automatic, used by frontend)

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 7) Deploy Contract

Deploy the Soroban contract to Stellar testnet.

### Prerequisites

- [soroban-cli](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli) installed
- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Stellar testnet account with secret key

### Deployment

Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable and run:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="S..." npm run deploy:contract
```

Or use the script directly:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="S..." ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will:

1. Build the contract
2. Deploy to Stellar testnet
3. Output the contract ID
4. Save the contract ID to `contracts/contract_id.txt`

### Environment Variables for Deployment

**Required:**

- `SECRET_KEY` - Stellar account secret key for deployment (must have testnet XLM for fees)

**Optional:**

- `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` - Network passphrase (defaults to testnet: `"Test SDF Network ; September 2015"`)
- `RPC_URL` - RPC endpoint URL (defaults to `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443`)

### After Deployment

1. Copy the contract ID from the output or `contracts/contract_id.txt`
2. Set `CONTRACT_ID` in your backend `.env` file
3. Ensure `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` is set in your backend `.env` file
4. Restart your backend service

## 8) Environment And Config

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in the values before starting the server.

The backend validates all environment variables **at startup**. If a required variable is missing or malformed, the process exits immediately with a descriptive error message rather than failing silently at runtime.

### Database

StellarStream uses **SQLite** for persistent storage. See [ADR 0001: SQLite vs PostgreSQL](docs/adr/0001-sqlite-storage.md) for the design rationale, migration path to PostgreSQL, and performance considerations.

### Soroban / On-chain mode vs. local-only mode

| Mode                          | When to use                                                    | How to enable                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Soroban enabled** (default) | Full on-chain integration — contract deployed, indexer running | Set `CONTRACT_ID` and `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| **Soroban disabled**          | Local UI/API development without a deployed contract           | Set `SOROBAN_DISABLED=true`                |

> ⚠️ `SOROBAN_DISABLED=true` is for local development only. Never set it in production or staging.

### Frontend variables

| Variable       | Required | Default | Description          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `VITE_API_URL` | No       | `/api`  | Backend API base URL |

### Webhook signing

- Header: `X-StellarStream-Signature`
- Format: `sha256=<hex-digest>`
- Digest input: raw JSON request body string
- Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256 using `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`

To verify a delivery, compute `sha256=` + HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` and compare it to the `X-StellarStream-Signature` header value using a constant-time comparison.

Example (Node.js):

```js
const { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } = require("crypto");
const expected =
  "sha256=" + createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest("hex");
const received = req.headers["x-stellarstream-signature"];
const valid = timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(received));
```

If `WEBHOOK_DESTINATION_URL` is set without `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, webhooks are delivered unsigned and a warning is logged at startup.

### Rate limiting

The API implements per-IP rate limiting on read and mutation endpoints:

**Read endpoints** (120 requests/minute per IP):

- `GET /api/streams`
- `GET /api/streams/:id`
- `GET /api/streams/:id/history`
- `GET /api/streams/:id/snapshot`
- `GET /api/recipients/:accountId/streams`
- `GET /api/senders/:accountId/streams`
- `GET /api/events`
- `GET /api/streams/export.csv`

**Mutation endpoints** (10 requests/minute per IP):

- `POST /api/streams` (create)
- `POST /api/streams/:id/cancel` (cancel)
- `POST /api/streams/:id/pause` (pause)
- `POST /api/streams/:id/resume` (resume)
- `POST /api/streams/:id/claim` (claim)

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns:

- **Status:** `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Header:** `Retry-After: <seconds>` (time until limit resets)
- **Body:** Error response with `code: "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`

Limits are configurable via environment variables:

- `READ_RATE_LIMIT` (default: 120 requests/minute)
- `MUTATION_RATE_LIMIT` (default: 10 requests/minute)
- `AUTH_CHALLENGE_RATE_LIMIT` (default: 10 requests/minute)

### Startup validation behaviour

The server validates config before doing anything else:

- **Missing `CONTRACT_ID` or `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`** (Soroban enabled) → exits with a message explaining how to deploy the contract and where to set the value.
- **Malformed `CONTRACT_ID`** (not 56 chars / not starting with `C`) → exits with a format hint.
- **Malformed `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`** (not 56 chars / not starting with `S`) → exits with a format hint.
- **Invalid `RPC_URL` or `WEBHOOK_DESTINATION_URL`** → exits with the bad value shown.
- **`SOROBAN_DISABLED=true`** → logs a notice and skips all Soroban checks; the event indexer does not start.

See `backend/src/config/validateEnv.ts` for the full validation logic.

## 10) Known Limitations

- Contract is not fully connected to backend execution path yet.
- Wallet sign/transaction flow is not active yet in UI.
- No authentication layer on write endpoints.
- Test coverage and CI can be expanded.
- Event indexer polls every 10 seconds (configurable).
- Contract bindings `(frontend/src/contracts/generated/)` must be regenerated locally after each deployment.

## 11) Suggested Next Steps
